IQ Sequence Guessing Game

This project is a simple C++ program that simulates a basic IQ-style challenge.
The program displays a number sequence with one missing value, and the player must guess the correct number that fits the pattern.

How It Works

The game generates a short sequence of numbers that follow a logical pattern.
One of the numbers is hidden and replaced with a question mark (?).
Your task is to observe the pattern, understand the rule, and enter the missing number.

Game Goal

The goal is to test and improve your logical thinking, attention, and numerical reasoning by recognizing patterns in number sequences.
